* Todo: look through the ember source code and try to understand what it is doing

scope & closures
- nested scope
- hoisting
- this
- closure

scope - where to look for things
more specifically, variables

scope lookup - variable is located in memory, somewhere
nested scopes

who is looking? 

JavaScript is a compiled language!! WTF?
The compiler in JS is significantly more complex than any other language.

Bash scripts and other types of interpreted scripts are definitely interpreted. They will fail in the middle. It goes top-down.

JS - syntax errors! Proof that it's impossible for it to be going top-down.

Let's treat the JS compiler like a person:

var foo = "bar"; // first variable declaration

function bar() { // 2nd declaration, a fn, still global scope
  var foo = "baz";
}

function baz(foo) {
  foo = "bam"; // no declaration here, no var keyword
  bam = "yay";
}

First task of the compiler: figure out variables
What are variable and function definitions? 
Line 1 has first declaration. This is the global scope.
JS treats this line like 2 separate operations that are processed
at different times. 
Line 3 has 2nd declaration.

Scope - think of this in terms of object hashes. 
key = scope, value = var/fn

We need to recursively step into the fn and interpret

JIT - just in time; when it comes across a particularly large, complex
fn, it will defer compilation until later. It will compile just before runtime.
